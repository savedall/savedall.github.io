There's something like pain in the room, and 
it's partly overcome: but the weight 
of objects wins, their way of signifying 
weight and loss.

There's something like red in the tree, but it's 
the orange of the lampstand 
bought in places I don't want to remember 
because they, too, carry weight.

Since I can know nothing of your hunger 
the stylized fountains are 
precise in their desire 
a destiny of people separated by oblique noise 
can, when overturned, fall into place quite well.

â€“ Amelia Rosselli</a>
